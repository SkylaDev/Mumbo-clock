Mumbo Clock was originally a PyGame powered desktop widget for your computer which would place a cute little Mumbo Jumbo telling you the time. Designed after [ElyBeatMaker's Outro Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7PPa8ZL5D4).

Turns out while possible this is super unpractical, its slow uses a ton of CPU usage and acts like a regular window meaning its on your taskbar all the time being a bit of a eyesore.

In the end I decided to remake the project using Rainmeter, a program designed for custom desktop widget's where the project remains, it even has little CPU and RAM widgets now hehe.

If you wish to still look into this old program you are in luck, in this repo I have included a ZIP archive of the program, if you for some reason want to look at the awful awful code behind this project then you are also in luck as it can be found over on [this repository](https://github.com/SkylaDev/MumboClockSource)!
